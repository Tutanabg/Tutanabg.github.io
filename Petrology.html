<h1> PETROLOGY</h1>

<p>Petrology,  a branch of Geology, is a Scientific study of rocks that deals with their composition, texture, and structure; their occurrence and distribution; and their origin in relation to physicochemical conditions and geologic processes. It is concerned with all three major types of rocks—igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. </p>

<p>Other branches of Geology like Structural Geology and Engineering Geology uses the classification of petrology of rocks when they conduct their study of orientation and physical properties of rock.</p>

<p>The classification and detail study of rock on its surface and within helped geologists to easly explore other planets of the solar system. </p> 

<span>It can be concluded that petrology is an essential part of Geology.</span>
